The repository contains a collection of ML/AI pipelines that I developed for data analysis, utilizing popular and powerful tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and caret. These frameworks provide access to a wide range of algorithms and models that can be used to build and train machine learning models. TensorFlow and PyTorch are particularly suitable for deep learning applications, while caret offers a convenient way to access a variety of machine learning algorithms.

Through evaluating these frameworks and building pipelines around them, I gained a deep understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This knowledge will be invaluable to me when working on new projects and selecting the appropriate tools for different data science endeavors.

In addition, I recognize that understanding the nature of the data, including the predictor variables, is crucial before any ML/AI work can begin. Therefore, I also attempted to build an exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline in this repository.

Overall, I am confident that this collection of ML/AI pipelines, combined with an EDA pipeline, will be a valuable resource for data analysts and machine learning enthusiasts.
